Usage

The user can insert the city name inside the textbox and press search to visualize scores about the most significant parameters of livability. City names must be in english. Not all cities are available, for this reason the user can display the list of all cities in teleport datatbase by cilcking the link on top right "all cities". In this section it is possible to have more detailed information also, thanks to Teleport city-score widget.
